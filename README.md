# pokerapp

This is a poker game app with user signup and login. Players start with 500 chips upon signup, with some random players 
recieving 1000 chips.  The app is seeded with a deck of cards and a fake user.  The account management page allows users to add payment information, purchase additional chips, or delete their account.

The leaderboard page has a button that displays all users with 1000+ chips.  

When a logged in user enters the game, their chips are loaded into the game.  The poker game evalutes pairs, three of a kind, 
and four of a kind without evaluating card rank.  Players can bet chips and their totals are adjusted accordingly.
